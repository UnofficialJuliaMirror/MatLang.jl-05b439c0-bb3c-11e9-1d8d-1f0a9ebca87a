Whereas in MATLAB a(4) = 3.2 can create the array a = [0 0 0 3.2] and a(5) = 7 can grow it into a = [0 0 0 3.2 7], the corresponding Julia statement a[5] = 7 throws an error if the length of a is less than 5 or if this statement is the first use of the identifier a. Julia has push! and append!, which grow Vectors much more efficiently than MATLAB's a(end+1) = val.\nThe imaginary unit sqrt(-1) is represented in Julia as im, not i or j as in MATLAB.\nIn Julia, literal numbers without a decimal point (such as 42) create integers instead of floating point numbers. As a result, some operations can throw a domain error if they expect a float; for example, julia> a = -1; 2^a throws a domain error, as the result is not an integer (see the FAQ entry on domain errors for details).\nIn Julia, multiple values are returned and assigned as tuples, e.g. (a, b) = (1, 2) or a, b = 1, 2. MATLAB's nargout, which is often used in MATLAB to do optional work based on the number of returned values, does not exist in Julia. Instead, users can use optional and keyword arguments to achieve similar capabilities.\nIn Julia, a:b and a:b:c construct AbstractRange objects. To construct a full vector like in MATLAB, use collect(a:b). Generally, there is no need to call collect though. An AbstractRange object will act like a normal array in most cases but is more efficient because it lazily computes its values. This pattern of creating specialized objects instead of full arrays is used frequently, and is also seen in functions such as range, or with iterators such as enumerate, and zip. The special objects can mostly be used as if they were normal arrays.\nFunctions in Julia return values from their last expression or the return keyword instead of listing the names of variables to return in the function definition (see The return Keyword for details).\nA Julia script may contain any number of functions, and all definitions will be externally visible when the file is loaded. Function definitions can be loaded from files outside the current working directory.\nIn Julia, reductions such as sum, prod, and max are performed over every element of an array when called with a single argument, as in sum(A), even if A has more than one dimension.\nIn Julia, parentheses must be used to call a function with zero arguments, like in rand().\nJulia discourages the use of semicolons to end statements. The results of statements are not automatically printed (except at the interactive prompt), and lines of code do not need to end with semicolons. println or @printf can be used to print specific output.\nIn Julia, if A and B are arrays, logical comparison operations like A == B do not return an array of booleans. Instead, use A .== B, and similarly for the other boolean operators like <, >.\nIn Julia, the operators &, |, and ⊻ (xor) perform the bitwise operations equivalent to and, or, and xor respectively in MATLAB, and have precedence similar to Python's bitwise operators (unlike C). They can operate on scalars or element-wise across arrays and can be used to combine logical arrays, but note the difference in order of operations: parentheses may be required (e.g., to select elements of A equal to 1 or 2 use (A .== 1) .| (A .== 2)).\nIn Julia, the elements of a collection can be passed as arguments to a function using the splat operator ..., as in xs=[1,2]; f(xs...).\nJulia's svd returns singular values as a vector instead of as a dense diagonal matrix.\nIn Julia, ... is not used to continue lines of code. Instead, incomplete expressions automatically continue onto the next line.\nIn both Julia and MATLAB, the variable ans is set to the value of the last expression issued in an interactive session. In Julia, unlike MATLAB, ans is not set when Julia code is run in non-interactive mode.\nJulia's structs do not support dynamically adding fields at runtime, unlike MATLAB's classes. Instead, use a Dict.\nIn Julia each module has its own global scope/namespace, whereas in MATLAB there is just one global scope.\nIn MATLAB, an idiomatic way to remove unwanted values is to use logical indexing, like in the expression x(x>3) or in the statement x(x>3) = [] to modify x in-place. In contrast, Julia provides the higher order functions filter and filter!, allowing users to write filter(z->z>3, x) and filter!(z->z>3, x) as alternatives to the corresponding transliterations x[x.>3] and x = x[x.>3]. Using filter! reduces the use of temporary arrays.\nThe analogue of extracting (or \"dereferencing\") all elements of a cell array, e.g. in vertcat(A{:}) in MATLAB, is written using the splat operator in Julia, e.g. as vcat(A...).","category":"page"},{"location":"development/#Development-1","page":"Development - Contribution","title":"Development","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"development/#","page":"Development - Contribution","title":"Development - Contribution","text":"clone the project in your usual way, or using the following command which clones the project in .julia\\dev\\MatLang","category":"page"},{"location":"development/#","page":"Development - Contribution","title":"Development - Contribution","text":"] dev https://github.com/juliamatlab/MatLang","category":"page"},{"location":"development/#","page":"Development - Contribution","title":"Development - Contribution","text":"cd to cloned package. if you used dev command, run the following:","category":"page"},{"location":"development/#","page":"Development - Contribution","title":"Development - Contribution","text":"cd(\"$(homedir())\\\\.julia\\\\dev\\\\MatLang\")","category":"page"},{"location":"development/#","page":"Development - Contribution","title":"Development - Contribution","text":"Activate the package:","category":"page"},{"location":"development/#","page":"Development - Contribution","title":"Development - Contribution","text":"] activate .","category":"page"},{"location":"development/#","page":"Development - Contribution","title":"Development - Contribution","text":"Set developing variable to true in the files in test and usage folder.","category":"page"},{"location":"development/#","page":"Development - Contribution","title":"Development - Contribution","text":"developing = true","category":"page"},{"location":"development/#","page":"Development - Contribution","title":"Development - Contribution","text":"Set developing variable to false before committing (for a successful CI build).","category":"page"},{"location":"development/#","page":"Development - Contribution","title":"Development - Contribution","text":"The package uses Revise for quick testing without the need for restarting.","category":"page"},{"location":"development/#Contribution-Coding-Standard-1","page":"Development - Contribution","title":"Contribution - Coding Standard","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"development/#","page":"Development - Contribution","title":"Development - Contribution","text":"For coding standard please refer to Coding Standard.
